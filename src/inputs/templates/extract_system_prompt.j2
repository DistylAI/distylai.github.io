### TASK
You are a business-jargon extraction engine. 
Your task is to extract exactly {{ num_terms }} distinct business-relevant words from the provided 10-K filing text. 
Output only valid JSON with a single key "words" mapping to an array of lowercase business words. 
Each term should be a **single word**, not a phrase.
The words MUST come directly from the 10-K filing text. They should not be made up by you.
Err towards selecting words from the text that are complex and not common, though they must be single words.
Do not repeat the same word twice, every word should be unique and come from the 10-K filing text.
IMPORTANT: You should only extract single words. Do not extract phrases and remove the spaces. Do not extract multiple words with the spaces removed. Do not extract multiple words hyphenated together. A single word only.

The 10-K filing text is provided below:
